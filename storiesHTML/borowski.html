					“This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen” is a story based during the Holocaust, 
					which focuses on the realities of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp as the narrator, 
					Tadeusz, takes his first trip to the railroad station to unload incoming Polish Jews. 
					The author of this work, Tadeusz Borowski was a Polish Catholic and, after making 
					copies of his poetry, was imprisoned for a period of time at Auschwitz. This year we 
					only read one text that focuses on the Holocaust or injustices towards the Jewish people. 
					Prior to and while reading this text, I was unsure if it made sense for the sole text we 
					read that concerns injustices towards Jews to be written by a non-Jewish author.
				</p>
				<p class="line"></p>
				<p>
					However, this text provides a new perspective of the concentration camps that is not often seen 
					in texts written by Jewish authors. I learned new things and got to view the camps through a 
					different viewpoint from Borowski’s work. People, myself included, often forget that the 
					Jews were not the only people impacted or targeted by the concentration camps. Borowski’s 
					writing, while it certainly highlights the horrible treatment the Jews faced, is meant to 
					show the realities of the concentration camps for all those who faced them.

						One of the views I gained from Borowski’s work is that the prisoners depended on new people 
						being brought to the camp for extermination. It is certainly a bleak view and horrible reality, 
						but that does not change its truth. This is clear from the the conversation between Tadeusz and 
						Henri at the beginning of the story:
				</p>
				<p class="quote">Tadeusz: “‘Can’t you see how much easier life is becoming around here: 
								no limit on packages, no more beatings? You even write letters home…One hears all kind of 
								talk, and, damnit, they’ll run out of people!’” (700)</p>
				<p class ="quote">Henri: “...‘Stop talking nonsense,’ he repeats, swallowing with effort. ‘They can’t run 
								out of people or we’ll starve to death in this blasted camp. All of us live on what they bring.’” (700) </p>
				
				<p class="line"></p>
				<p>
					Their conversation demonstrates how the prisoners’ survival became tragically dependent on the constant 
					arrival of new victims, underscoring the dehumanizing reality of the concentration camps for all that faced 
					them. This previously unfamiliar perspective to me has once again highlighted the cruelty of the Nazi ideology 
					and its systems where people become reliant on the suffering of others as Henri states: ”All of us live on what 
					they bring.” Overall, it is a clear demonstration of the vast and extreme damage of oppressive systems.
