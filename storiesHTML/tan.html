		Reading Amy Tan’s, “The Language of Discretion” helped me to understand concepts I had only begun to think about 
		as I began learning Hebrew and American Sign Language this semester. It was thoughtful and thorough about how 
		language shapes cultures and our perceptions of others. Tan’s work focuses on the nuances between 
		Chinese and American English. Despite never having learned a word of Chinese, I still found myself 
		relating closely to Tan’s perspective from my experiences with other languages.

		Tan highlights the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis which connects people’s perception of the world to language. 
		Tan includes the following quote from Sapir, which I have found to powerfully summarize this ideal:
		</p>
		<p class="quote">
		“...No two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality. 
		The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different 
		labels attached.” (160-161)
		</p>
		<p class="line"></p>
		<p>
		For me, This quote, especially through Sapir’s emphasis that languages lead to “distinct” realities, 
		underscores that language functions as more than just a communication tool, but rather a tool that 
		shapes realities. Tan highlights this principle in her discussion of the Chinese language regarding 
		its indirectness in responding “yes” or “no”. She explains that this reflects how agreement and disagreement 
		are perceived in Chinese culture, which contrasts the much more direct approach of English.
		</p>
		</section>
		</div>
		<section class="centerSection" style="padding-bottom: 2em;">
		<p class="quote">
		“To this day, I wonder which parts of my behavior were shaped by Chinese, which by English.” (161)
		</p>
		<p class="line"</p>
		<p>
		Reading this really prompted me to further consider how important language is to the human experience. 
		Tan’s reflection in the quote above powerfully reflect the ideals of her earlier assertion:
		</p>
		<p class="quote">
		“Language has become the peg and the shelf that enables us to sort out and categorize the world…
		How would language, the enabler, have changed our perception with slight vocabulary variations?” (160)
		</p>
		<p class="line"></p>
		<p>
		These two statements, taken together, have led me to consider the intricate and often unconscious 
		or unintentional ways in which different languages affect communication and shape people’s identities. 
		Through learning about Tan’s perspective on language, I have been able to connect my own languages with 
		that of my identity, similar to how Tan did with Chinese and English to her own. Personally, I grew up and 
		live in an English speaking household with a variety of Yiddish and Hebrew words thrown in the mix. These 
		words are the words I associate more with my family and my culture. Ultimately, Tan’s insights in “The Language 
		of Discretion” have highlighted and made me realize the deep and personal connection between language and identity, 
		and in the process prompted me to realize how my own language background has and continues to shape my reality.
