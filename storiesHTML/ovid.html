			<tab>Metamorphosis is one of my favorite texts I read during HON 171. We read five stories for class: 
			“The Creation” (Book I), “Apollo and Daphne” (Book I), “Jove and Io” (Book II), “Iphis and Isis” 
			(Book IX), and “Pygmalion” (Book X). While I enjoyed all of these stories, I have chosen to discuss 
			the first, second, and fourth below, as I found “The Creation” and “Apollo and Daphne” to 
			resonate with me the most and “Iphis and Isis” to bring forth the most questions.

					<h4>"The Creation" (Book I)</h4>
					<p>
						While short and one of many existing creation myths, Ovid’s “The Creation” offers a 
						particularly striking perspective on humanity’s position in the world and impact on it.
					</p>
					<p class="quote">“the fabricator of this better world, / created man out of his own divine / substance” (1032)</p>
					<p>
						Through these lines, Ovid directly connects humans and the divine, suggesting our origin is from the gods. 
						This highlights humanity’s significance, especially considering how in later stories Ovid 
						showcases how divinity is worshipped. Therefore, the idea that humans are part divine 
						emphasizes human potential and importance.
					</p>
					<p class="quote">
						“He gave man a face that is uplifted, / and ordered him to stand erect and look 
						/ directly up into the vaulted heavens / and turn his countenance to meet the stars; 
						/ the earth, that so lately rude and formless, / was changed by taking on the shapes of men.” (1032)
					</p>
					<p>
						This portion further elaborates on humanity’s unique position in the universe. By stating that 
						humans look towards the stars, it suggests we focus on the future as well as elevates us beyond 
						the simplicities of the Earth. More importantly, Ovid’s assertion that humanity shaped the Earth 
						is truly symbolic of the power humans wield and the impact our actions have. It is an important 
						reminder that the Earth is made in our image —“taking on the shapes of men”—and that we are 
						responsible for its reality.

					<h4>"Apollo and Daphne" (Book I)</h4>
					<p>
						This story was my favorite of the stories from <em>Metamorphoses</em>. It excellently demonstrates the feminine 
						potential in the face of adversity. While perhaps an uncommon interpretation, I believe it is important to focus on 
						Daphne’s defiance of social norms rather than society’s prejudice against women when reading this story.
					</p>
					<p class="quote">
						“Help me, dear father! If your waters hold / divinity, transform me and destroy / that beauty by 
						which I have too well pleased!” (1035)</p>
					<p>
						While definitely an extremely twisted way of demonstrating it, Daphne shows courage by running 
						away from a god. Despite being a woman in ancient times, she still stands up for herself rather 
						than giving into Apollo’s desires. Furthermore, her prayer for transformation demonstrates her determination 
						to protect herself and agency over her own fate. She demonstrates that even in the worst situations, resistance 
						and hope are still possible.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The story concludes with Apollo claiming the Laurel. This raises questions about the actual success of 
						Daphne’s escape. However, for me, the significance of this story does not lie in its ending, but instead in Daphne’s 
						courage and determination to attempt escape in the first place. Regardless of her success, Daphne demonstrates the power 
						women have to stand up to others and oppressive societal expectations.

					<h4>"Iphis and Isis" (Book IX)</h4>
					<p>
						This story closely relates to current societal and political discussions regarding sexuality and gender 
						identity. It offers a potentially modern but ultimately inconclusive perspective on the subjects. The 
						final lines of the story, describing the wedding, particularly lead to numerous questions.
					</p>
					<p class="quote">
						“The next day’s sun revealed the great wide world / with Venus, Juno, and Hymen all together / gathered beneath 
						the smoking nuptial torches, / and Iphis in the possession of Ianthe.” (1057)
					</p>
					<p>
						I read the presence of Venus, Juno, and Hymen at the wedding as divine approval of Iphis’ gender 
						change and marriage to Ianthe. However, this is only one interpretation of the story, and realistically 
						the story’s views of gender and sexuality are far from clear, and many questions are raised:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Do the gods approve of Iphis’ marriage because they want Ianthe and Iphis to marry, or do they 
							approve because the marriage is between a man and a woman following Iphis’ transformation?</li>
						<li>Would they still approve of the marriage had Isis not transformed Iphis from female to male?</li>
						<li>Does the story support homosexuality by showing two women falling in love? </li>
						<li>Or, since Ianthe believes Iphis to be a man, does the story instead oppose same-sex love?</li>
						<li>Does Isis transforming Iphis from female to male indicate a support for the possibility of gender/sex 
							change, or is the transformation solely to ensure Ianthe and Iphis have a heterosexual marriage?</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Ultimately, while this story relates to modern issues of gender and sexuality, its stance on such issues is 
						less clear and dependent on interpretation, capable of supporting various perspectives and opinions.
